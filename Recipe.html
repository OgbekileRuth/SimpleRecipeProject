    <h1 style="color:chocolate;">PANCAKE</h1>
    <p>
    A fluffy, golden-brown breakfast treat made with a batter of flour, eggs, and milk, cooked on griddle and served with sweet or savory toppings.</p>        
    reffered to as Diet in Nigeria, it contains protein(eggs), carbohydrate(Flour)and fats and oil(from the butter and vegetables)
    </p>
    <h2 style="color:aquamarine;">Pancake Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>1 cup | 150g of plain flour</li>
    <li>2 medium eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup | 125 mls of evaporated milk(peak or carnation are common in Nigeria)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of margarine</li>
    <li>1 cup | 250 mls of water</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>6 teaspoons of sugar (or to taste)</li>
    <li>Ground chilli pepper (to taste)</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color:darkgoldenrod;"> Step-by-Step Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the magarine in a small bowl and melt in the microwave. You can also place the bowl in a bigger bowl of hot water to melt the magarine.</li>
        <li>Break the two eggs into the melted margarine and beat till smooth. Then add 1/2 cup of water</li>
        <li>Add the flour and mix well till there are minimal lumps.</li>
        <li>Add the milk, salt, sugar, grounded pepper and the remaining 1/2 cup of water, stir well.</li>
        <li>Blend the mix using a liquid blender. This will give the pancake batter the smoothest consistency. If you don't want to blend it, no problem, just mix the ingredients very well so that the lumps are minimal</li>
        </ol>
        Note:You can also add onions to the pancake but make sure that your blender can liquefy the onions. If not, the pieces of onions will not let you achieve very thin pancakes.

        <h3 style="color:darkolivegreen;"> Cooking Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a frying pan over medium heat. Add a few drops of vegetable oil. Just enough to lubricate the frying pan.</li>
        <li>When hot, pour some pancake batter into the frying pan, Tilt the pan so that the batter coats the surface of the pan evenly. This should be a very thin coat.</li>
        <li>Fry the underside of the pancake for approximately 1 minute, shaking the pan from time to time till the pancake comes loose. You can also loosen it with the spatula. Check the underside to be sure it has browned to your liking, preferably light brown.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancake so you can fry the top side as well</li>
        <li>The pancake is done when both sides are light brown.</li>

        </div>
        <h2 style="color:cadetblue;">SPAGHETTI</h2>
        <p>
        A type of pasta made in the shape of long thin strings,
        Also classic Italian favorite, featuring long, slender strands of pasta tossed in a rich, tangy tomato sauce and topped with parmesan cheese.
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti: The quantity you can wrap between your thumb and index finger</li>
        <li>Beef: 5-6 normal cuts</li>
        <li>Vegetables: 500g</li>
            - Cabbage
            - Green pepper
            - Carrots
            - Green peas
            - Green beans
        <li>Tomato Stew: 600mls or 20fl. oz.</li>
        <li>Pepper and salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Onions: 1 medium bulb</li>
        <li>Seasoning - 2-3 stock cubes cubes & Thyme (1 teaspoon)</li>
    
        </ul>
        <h2 style="color:darkgoldenrod;">Step-by-Step Instruction</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Make some tomato stew if you do not have any.</li>
        <li>Break the spaghetti into short pieces. I usually break one strand of spaghetti into three pieces.</li>
        <li>Cut the beef into small pieces. It is best to buy the part of the beef that has streaks of fat in it. This greatly improves the taste of this recipe</li>
        <li>Wash and cut the cabbage, green pepper and green beans into small pieces. Also wash, scrape and cut the carrots into tiny pieces. Cut the onions into small pieces and remove the green peas from the pods. If you will use tinned green peas, simply drain the preservation water and rinse with some fresh water.</li>
        </ol>

    
    <p>Tips for Cooking Spaghetti:</p>
    
    Spaghetti should be cooked with a very big pot. The pot should contain the spaghetti and still have plenty of unused volume.
    Spaghetti should also be cooked in plenty of water. The quantity of water should be at least double the quantity of the spaghetti.
    To cook spaghetti, first of all, boil water; add a few spoons of vegetable oil to the boiling water and add the spaghetti. Stir the contents very well and cover the pot. With some spaghetti, you need to stir till the water starts to boil again before covering the pot.
    The large amount of water, the boiling water and the vegetable oil altogether prevent the spaghetti strands from sticking together.
    </p>

    <h3 style="color:darkolivegreen;">Cooking Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the beef with the onions, thyme and stock cubes (Maggi or Knorr).</li>
        <li>While the meat is cooking, start cooking the spaghetti in a generous amount of water</li>
        <li>When the beef is done, add the tomato stew. Add the vegetables, salt and pepper to taste and cook for about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>When the spaghetti is done to your personal preference, drain the water and pour the mixture of beef stock and tomato stew you prepared earlier into the pot of spaghetti. Stir well, cover and leave to stand for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>The Spaghetti is ready to be served.</li>

        </div>
        <h1 style="color:aquamarine;">Gizdodo</h1>
        <p>Gizdodo: A popular Nigerian dish prepared with a combination of gizzards and plantains, all fried to a crispy perfection and seasoned with spices.Gizdodo is also known as Gizzards and dodo, or Gizdodo, so if you see it on a buffet menu, don't be surprised, it's just a normal gizzards and plantain meal with a new name.</p>
        <h2 style="color:darkblue;">Gizdodo Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>500 grams, Chicken gizzards</li>
                <li>1 ripe Plantain</li>
                <li>3 large Roma tomatoes (fresh tomatoes)</li>
                <li>2 Habenero pepper (atarodo)(to suit your taste)</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper (tatashe) (optional)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoonful ground Crayfish(optional)</li>
                <li>1 large onion bulb (cut into 2 halves)</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove/half teaspoon garlic powder(optional)</li>
                <li>Half teaspoon each of Curry and Thyme</li>
                <li>2 bouillon/stock cubes</li>
                <li>Vegetable oil (enough for frying)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2 style="color:darkgoldenrod;"> Step-by-Step Instruction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean the Gizzards by removing the yellow lining. Then wash the gizzards with salted water or lemon juice. Scrub well to get rid of any dirt. Then Rinse the gizzards in running water, strain and set aside. You can cut the cooked gizzards into smaller bite sizes.</li>
            Tip: If you buy yours pre-packed, it is possible that the yellow lining won't be there, so simply wash in salted water or lime/lemon juice,rinse and strain.

            <li>Place the cleaned gizzards into a pot; pour enough water to half the level of the gizzards. Season the gizzard with half onion bulb, garlic, one stock cube, thyme, curry and salt to taste. Cook until tender and set aside.</li>
            Tip: Gizzard is a tough meat(a muscle meat to be precise) and most people assume that it does not absorb any of the seasonings while cooking. But i highly recommend that you season the gizzards properly using as much seasoning as you are comfortable with and let the stock dry as it cooks the meat. You'll be amazed at how tasty,gizzards can be!

            <li>Next, Cut the plantains into cubes, just like it was done here and fry in hot vegetable oil until brown. Transfer onto a sieve.</li>
        </ol>
            Note: Chicken gizzards is best used for this recipe, but you can also substitute it for turkey or duck gizzards. As for the plantains, I'll highly recommend ripe plantains, but not overly ripe, so that you don't end up with a less appealing meal.

        <h3 style="color:darkolivegreen;">Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fry the gizzards in the same oil until brown and also transfer onto a sieve lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
            Tip: For a healthier option, grill the gizzards in the oven until brown.

            <li>Chop the tomatoes and peppers and blend coarsely</li>
            <li>Heat up some oil, add chopped onions, fry a bit and add the ground crayfish (remember the crayfish is optional)</li>
            <li>Stir-Fry for 5 seconds and then pour the blended mix into the pot and fry for about 10-15 minutes or until the sour taste is lost.</li>
            <li>Then add one stock cube and salt to taste. Cook for 2 minutes. And set aside</li>
            Tip: You'll know the sauce is ready when the oil rises to the top of the stew.

            <li>Add the fried gizzards to the sauce and cook for i minute to soak in the sauce.</li>

        </p>
        <h2 style="color:brown;">Plantain Mosa Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            The following ingredients give 16 medium balls of Plantain Mosa
            <li>1 over-ripe plantain</li>
            <li>3 heaped tablespoons plain flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fast action yeast</li>
            <li>8 table spoon warm water</li>
            <li>Habenero pepper</li>
            <li>Salt (to Taste)</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>  
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color:chocolate;">More information about the ingredients</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The vegetable oil should be about 3 inches deep when poured into the pot.</li>
            <li>You can use cayenne pepper (fresh or dry) in the absence of Habanero pepper. The dry one needs to be ground into powder before use.</li>
        <h2 style="color:darkgoldenrod;"> Step-by-Step Instruction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the fast action yeast with the warm water making sure there are no lumps. Cover and set aside.</li>
            <li>Peel the overripe plantain and mash with a fork till a good blend is achieved. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Sift the plain flour and the salt into a sizeable bowl. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Add the yeast solution and stir till you get a medium consistency. If it is too thick, add a few more tablespoons of warm water and mix till you get a medium consistency.</li>
            <li>Add the mashed plantain. Mix with a spatula till well incorporated.</li>
            <li>Cover with aluminium foil. leave in a warm place to rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After that time, you'll notice that it a bit fluffy</li>
            <li>Beat the batter with a spoon then add the habanero pepper (cut into pieces)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 style="color:darkolivegreen;">Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat some vegetable oil in a pot. The oil should be about 3 inches deep. The oil is hot enough when a small quantity of batter dropped into the oil sizzles and quickly comes to the surface of the oil</li>
            <li>Scoop small amounts of the batter into the oil using your finger tips. Watch as they sizzle, come up to the surface of the oil and puff up.</li>
            <li>Stir constantly till golden. Reduce the heat if you think the plantain mosas are browning too quickly. This is to ensure that the inside is well cooked by the time the outside gets brown.</li>
            <li>When done, transfer to a paper-lined sieve to drain. And your Plantain Mosa is Ready.</li>
